## Description
DINOSAUR SKATE EXTINCTION is a 2D- classic survival video game in pixelated retro design developed with Canvas and DOM manipulation.
It challenges players to test their skateboarding abilities by navigating REXO - the dino skater - through a treacherous town jungle while avoiding a hail of comets. The game's objective is to keep REXO for as long as possible on his skateboard, accumulating points along the way. The game's ultimate goal is to achieve a score of 100 points. 

## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)

- one character - REXO: moves horizontally and vertically 
- two house obstacle (appear randomly from the right side) and one comet obstacle (appear randomly from the top of the screen)
 -> a collision with one of the obstacle will end the game
- score counter on the right top corner of the game board 
 -> score is counting till 100
- by reaching a score of 100, game is won 

## Backlog
